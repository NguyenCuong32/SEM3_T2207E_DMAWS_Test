- Technology choice:
I would choose to use cloud computing technology to build the online ordering and shopping website. Cloud computing is a scalable and cost-effective solution that can meet the changing needs of the business over time.
- Reasons:
 + Scalability: Cloud computing is highly scalable, meaning that the resources can be easily scaled up or down to meet the changing demand. This is important for the retail company because the demand for online shopping is likely to fluctuate throughout the year, especially during peak seasons like Black Friday.
 + Cost-effectiveness: Cloud computing can be a very cost-effective solution, especially for businesses that have variable workloads. With cloud computing, businesses only pay for the resources that they use. This can save the business a significant amount of money on infrastructure and maintenance costs.
 + Ease of use: Cloud computing is relatively easy to use and manage. This means that the retail company can focus on its core business activities, such as marketing and sales, without having to worry about the technical aspects of the website.
